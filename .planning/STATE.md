# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-10)

**Core value:** A technical evaluator finishes the document believing the author genuinely understands their problem — because complex things were made simple without being made wrong.

Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-09-10 — ROADMAP.md and STATE.md created; 53/53 v1 requirements mapped across 6 phases

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 6 phases derived from 53 v1 requirements at "standard" granularity — matches research's suggested structure after independent validation against the actual requirement set.
- Roadmap: CAT-07 (numbering namespaces) and EX-01 (shared deal brief) frozen in Phase 1, not treated as later cleanup — retrofitting reserved ranges after organic numbering would force the exact renumbering the scheme exists to prevent.
- Roadmap: MOD-03/04/05 (three-category check output, artifact classification, citation guarantee) placed in Phase 3, not Phase 2, because they have real dependencies on the MEDDICC checklist and artifact patterns; MOD-01/02 (basic draft/check) stay in Phase 2 since they only need the prose catalog.
- Roadmap: LEG-04 (legal review gate) and LEG-05 (README badges) held to a dedicated Phase 6, separate from Phase 1's general legal scaffolding (LEG-01/02/03) — the MEDDIC/MEDDICC/MEDDPICC trademark litigation risk is load-bearing, not a footnote.
- Roadmap: Phase 4 (distribution) and Phase 5 (eval harness) both depend only on Phases 2-3 and not on each other — flagged as parallelizable given config's parallelization setting.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- MEDDICC/MEDDIC trademark status beyond the "MEDDPICC ruled generic" ruling (E.D. Pa., April 2026) is unresolved. Must be reconfirmed against current sources before Phase 6's legal review gate (LEG-04) closes — do not assume the whole acronym family is safe by extension.
- Linter's buzzword-proxy word list (EVAL-02) must be sourced independently from SKILL.md's own worked examples, or the Phase 5 benchmark becomes circular — flag explicitly during Phase 5 planning, not left implicit.
- README badges (LEG-05) have a hard dependency on Phase 5's benchmark having actually run — sequence Phase 6 accordingly, do not draft badge claims early.
